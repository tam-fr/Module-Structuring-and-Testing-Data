# 🧭 Guide to week 2 exercises

## Errors

In this section, you need to go to each file in `errors` directory and run the file with node to check what the error is. Your task is to interpret the error message and explain why it occurs. The [errors documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors) will help you figure out the solution.

## Debug

In this section, you need to go to each file in `debug` to **explain and predict** why the program isn't behaving as intended. Then you'll need to run the program with node to check your prediction. You will also need to correct the code too.

## Implement

In this section, you will have a short set of requirements about a function. You will need to implement a function based off this set of requirements.Make sure you check your function works for a number of different inputs.
Here is a recommended order:

1. `to-pounds.js`
2. `vat.js`
3. `cases.js`
4. `bmi.js`

## Interpret

In these tasks, you have to interpret a slightly larger program with some syntax / operators / functions that may be unfamiliar.
You must use documentation to make sense of anything unfamiliar - learning how to look things up this way is a fundamental part of being a developer!
You can also use `console.log` to check the value of different variables in the code.

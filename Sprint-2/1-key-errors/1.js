// Predict and explain first...

// Why will an error occur when this program runs?
// =============> write your prediction here              --> decimalNumber is a variable which is declarer already

// Try playing computer with the example to work out what is going on

function convertToPercentage(decimalNumber) {
  // const decimalNumber = 0.5;
  const percentage = `${decimalNumber * 100}%`;

  return percentage;
}
const test = 0.25;
console.log(convertToPercentage(test));

// =============> write your explanation here

// Finally, correct the code to fix the problem
// =============> write your new code here

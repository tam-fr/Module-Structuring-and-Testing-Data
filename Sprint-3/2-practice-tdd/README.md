# Practice TDD

In this section you'll practice this key skill of building up your program test first.

Use the Jest syntax and complete the provided files, meeting the acceptance criteria for each function. Use the VSCode test runner to run your tests and check your progress.

Write the tests _before_ the code that will make them pass.

Recommended order:

1. `count.test.js`
1. `repeat.test.js`
1. `get-ordinal-number.test.js`
